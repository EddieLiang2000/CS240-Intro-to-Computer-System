    After looking at all those different APIs, I found there are many things they have in common. First, they are all RESTful APIs, meaning all of them are of client-server-based mode on HTTP web services. While some like National Weather Service in which response is through Json Object, we enter the information we want to search for then get back the answers; on the other hand, Queue is different in a way that it is actually interaction between two people, we send a request then wait for another person to answer that request. The second thing is, they all require some sort of authentications. Either you need to create an account for yourself, then use under that account or you can receive an API key with your email. There are millions of accesses, or maybe much more than that for every day, so authentication is needed to prevent from interfering with the wrong data. Third, they all include some tutorials and many explanations for different functions and list them out. This is pretty nice because for people like us, who are still students that may interact with API for the first time, do not really know where to start with and what functions we can implement when building our own web services. But the tutorials provide some very necessary information.

	The first API outside the 5 provided API that I looked for is League of Legends API which is provided by Riot. Some the features are really interesting, like get free champion rotation for every week or get all active tournament information or you can enter summonerID to get someoneâ€™s rank. The other is Airline API. They are many of them to choose, some may come from airline company like UA or AA, some may be found on certain unknown websites. But both are same if you want to find out information about a particular flight on a given date with given flight number, just like how to prepare to book a ticket with apps like Expedia.

    1. Definitely a very good looking or interactive website for my api because I find that a very old-fashioned and terrible format makes me want to get away any second
    2. A interactive testing example to show people how to operate on my API, like through a mini-coding screen on part of my website
    3. A clear guide and tutorial as how to go to different part of API and how to start with from the basics
